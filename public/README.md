Our final project is a recreation of Super Mario Bros. 
In the checkpoint, we designed our start page of the final project.

Use mouse to choose the menu options. 
When the mouse is put on the menu options, a mushroom would appear to the left of the option.
Click to enter the game or check the instruction.

Enter the instruction, use the mouse to scroll down the page. Click the button to enter the game.

For now, we have not written the game, so clicking the game button, it would have no reaction.

In order to run the code, you have to creat a local server to run the code at http://localhost
For further instruction, see https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server

Use arrow key to control the Mario!
